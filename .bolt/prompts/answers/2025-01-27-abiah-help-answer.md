I've implemented a complete MVP for the Abiah.help platform following all the provided specifications. The implementation includes:

### Architecture Decisions

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - Email/password registration and login
   - Social authentication (Google, LinkedIn) 
   - Password reset functionality
   - User profile management with avatar upload
   - Secure session handling

2. **Hero Section with Video Welcome**

### File Organization
Created a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the AI mentorship platform with all requested features and follows production-ready best practices.
