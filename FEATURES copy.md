## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Plan - Business Plan Document Management

The Plan
1. User Authentication and Authorization
The system already has an authentication and user management system in place. For bachtiare@gmail.com, this user would need to be registered within the system. Access to documents and features will be tied to their authenticated session and associated permissions.

2. Document Storage and Generation
The system will generate business plan documents using its AI-powered engine. These generated documents will be stored securely, likely within Supabase Storage, with a logical structure that can be mapped to /users/{user_email}/documents/business-plan/ on the backend. The frontend will interact with API endpoints that abstract this storage location.

3. In-Browser Document Viewer
This involves enhancing the document display capabilities to provide a rich, interactive viewing experience.

Modify src/pages/Documents.tsx: This page will serve as the entry point for viewing generated documents. It should list the user's documents and allow selection for viewing.
Enhance src/components/documents/DocumentPreview.tsx: This component will be responsible for rendering the generated business plan documents directly in the browser.
It should parse the document content (which is likely JSON or Markdown from the AI generation) and render it into a readable HTML format.
Ensure clear readability with appropriate typography, spacing, and layout.
Implement clear organization and indexing of document sections, possibly by generating a table of contents or navigation sidebar based on the document's structure.
Update src/types/Documents.ts: Ensure the Document interface includes fields necessary for structured content and section metadata.
4. PDF Generation/Export Capability
This feature will allow users to download their generated business plans as PDFs.

Modify src/components/documents/ExportOptions.tsx: This component will contain the button for triggering PDF generation and download.
Refine src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts: This utility will take the rendered HTML content from the DocumentPreview component and convert it into a PDF. It should ensure that the PDF output maintains the clear readability and organization of the in-browser viewer.
Update src/api/documents.ts: Add an endpoint or modify an existing one to trigger the PDF generation process on the backend (if complex server-side rendering is required) or to handle the client-side PDF generation and download.
5. Progress Tracking Implementation
This is a new core feature that will track and visualize the user's progress through the business plan document.

Update Database Schema (Backend):
You'll need a mechanism to store which sections of a document a user has reviewed. This could be a new JSONB field within the documents table (e.g., progress_data JSONB) or a new table like document_progress that links user_id, document_id, and completed_sections. For an MVP, adding a progress_data field to the documents table is simpler.
The progress_data field would store an array of section IDs that have been marked as reviewed or completed by the user.
Modify src/components/documents/DocumentPreview.tsx:
Section Interaction: Implement a way for users to mark sections as "reviewed" or "complete." This could be a checkbox next to each section heading, or an automatic trigger when a user scrolls past a certain percentage of a section.
Progress Calculation: Based on the total number of sections in a document and the number of marked/reviewed sections, calculate the completion percentage.
Auto-Save Progress: Implement event listeners (e.g., on section completion, or on a timed interval) to automatically save the user's progress to the backend via an API call.
Create src/components/documents/ProgressBar.tsx: Develop a new reusable UI component to display a visual progress bar. This component will take the calculated completion percentage as a prop.
Integrate Progress Bar:
Add the ProgressBar.tsx component to the DocumentPreview.tsx component, typically at the top of the document viewer.
Consider adding it to the DocumentCard components in the dashboard (src/components/dashboard/DocumentHistory.tsx) to show progress at a glance.
Update src/api/documents.ts: Add an API endpoint (e.g., PATCH /api/documents/:id/progress) to update the progress_data for a specific document.
Update src/types/Documents.ts: Add the progress_data field to the Document interface and define its structure.
6. Document Access and Permissions
The existing authentication system will handle user login. Permissions for reading, tracking progress, and downloading will be enforced on the backend, with the frontend reflecting these rights.

Backend Authorization (Conceptual): Ensure your Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies or backend API logic restrict document access to the owner (user_id) and any explicitly shared collaborators.
Frontend Display: The frontend will simply attempt to fetch the document. If the user bachtiare@gmail.com is authenticated and has the correct user_id associated with the document, the document will load. If not, an error or "access denied" message will be displayed.
Feature Enablement: Buttons for PDF download and progress tracking will be enabled by default for the document owner. If sharing features are implemented later, these could be conditionally enabled based on shared permissions.
