## 2. System Architecture Overview

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

> **Note:** Daily.co is the default and only supported video engine for the MVP. Agora.io is reserved for future scalability or as a fallback provider. All MVP flows and integration patterns should assume Daily.co as the primary video engine.

* **Frontend Clients**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile), PWA
* **Video Layer**: Tavus AI API for real-time video avatars and conversations
* **AI Core**:

  * LLM Orchestration Engine: OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo + Anthropic Claude + Custom Fine-tunes
  * AI Intent Router: Route queries to appropriate AI skill (e.g., pitch deck, hiring, strategy)
* **Orchestration Layer**: Node.js/TypeScript API Gateway + GraphQL for real-time interactions
* **Document Engine**: Markdown + JSON schema-based doc generator with AI slot-filling
* **Data Layer**:

  * PostgreSQL (metadata), Pinecone (vector search), Redis (cache), S3 (recordings/docs)
* **Infra**: AWS EKS, Terraform, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Istio service mesh
