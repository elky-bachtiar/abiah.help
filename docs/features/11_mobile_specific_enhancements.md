## üìã Implementation Details

### Device Capability Detection
```typescript
interface DeviceCapabilities {
  hasCamera: boolean;
  hasMicrophone: boolean;
  hasTouch: boolean;
  hasGyroscope: boolean;
  connectionType: 'wifi' | '4g' | '3g' | '2g' | 'slow-2g' | 'unknown';
  screenSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  deviceMemory?: number; // in GB
  isIOS: boolean;
