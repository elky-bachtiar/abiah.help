## üåê Research & Best Practices

### Sources Reviewed
- [ ] [Material Design - Notifications](https://material.io/design/platform-guidance/android-notifications.html)
- [ ] [Nielsen Norman Group - Notification UX](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/notification-systems/)
- [ ] [React Hot Toast Library](https://react-hot-toast.com/)

- [ ] [Web API - Push Notifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)
- [ ] [Offline UX Best Practices](https://web.dev/offline-ux-design-guidelines/)

### Key Findings
- **Best Practice 1**: Non-blocking notifications for most user actions
- **Best Practice 2**: Clear visual hierarchy based on notification importance
- **Best Practice 3**: Persistence based on notification criticality
- **UX Consideration**: Prevent notification fatigue with grouping and thresholds
- **Performance Optimization**: Use React Portals for toast rendering outside the main DOM
- **Design Pattern**: Network status indicators with actionable retry options

### Technology Stack
- **Primary**: React + TypeScript, Framer Motion for animations
- **Supporting**: Jotai for global state, React Portals for rendering
- **Network**: Browser Online/Offline API, Service Worker for offline events
- **Persistence**: Supabase for server-stored notifications, localStorage for offline cache
- **Accessibility**: Focus management, ARIA roles, screen reader support

## üìã Implementation Details

### Data Models
- **Notification**
  ```typescript
  interface Notification {
    id: string;
    type: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';
    title: string;
    message: string;
    created_at: Date;
    read: boolean;
    read_at?: Date;
    expires_at?: Date;
    action?: {
      label: string;
      onClick: () => void;
    };
    autoDismiss: boolean;
    dismissTimeout?: number; // in milliseconds
    persistent: boolean;
    category?: string; // for grouping and filtering
    icon?: string;
    user_id?: string; // for user-specific notifications
  }
  ```

- **NotificationPreferences**
  ```typescript
  interface NotificationPreferences {
    user_id: string;
    enabled_categories: Record<string, boolean>; // e.g., { 'system': true, 'document': true }
    toast_duration: number; // in milliseconds
    sound_enabled: boolean;
    show_in_notification_center: boolean;
  }
  ```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user's notifications
- `POST /api/notifications/read/:id` - Mark notification as read
- `POST /api/notifications/read-all` - Mark all notifications as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete a notification
- `DELETE /api/notifications/clear-all` - Clear all notifications
- `PUT /api/notifications/preferences` - Update notification preferences

### Component Architecture
- **NotificationProvider**: Context provider wrapping the app
- **Toast Component**: Animated notification that appears and disappears
- **Notification Center**: Dropdown or slide-in panel with notification history
- **ConnectionStatus**: Network status indicator with offline mode actions

### Event Flow
1. Event triggers notification creation (API response, user action, system event)
2. NotificationProvider processes the notification
3. For toast notifications:
   - Toast animates into view
   - Auto-dismisses after timeout (if configured)
   - Can be manually dismissed
4. For persistent notifications:
   - Stored in notification store
   - Badge count updated
   - Added to notification center
5. User can view full notification history in notification center
6. User can manage notification preferences in settings

## üñºÔ∏è UI/UX Design

### Toast Components
- **Success Toast**: Green with checkmark icon, auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
- **Error Toast**: Red with error icon, requires manual dismissal by default
- **Warning Toast**: Yellow/Amber with warning icon, auto-dismisses after 6 seconds
- **Info Toast**: Blue with info icon, auto-dismisses after 4 seconds
- **Custom Action Toast**: Any type with added action button

### Connection Status Indicator
- **Online**: Subtle green dot in header or footer
- **Offline**: More prominent warning indicator with "Working Offline" message
- **Syncing**: Animated icon showing background synchronization activity

### Notification Center UI
- **Badge**: Red badge with unread count on header notification icon
- **Panel**: Sliding panel from top or side with notification list
- **List Item**: Each notification with icon, title, message, timestamp
- **Actions**: Mark as read, delete, and related action buttons
- **Empty State**: Friendly message when no notifications exist

### Visual Design
- **Animation**: Smooth slide and fade animations for toasts
- **Positioning**: Top-right corner for toast notifications (configurable)
- **Stacking**: Multiple notifications stack with slight overlap
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Bottom position on small screens for better reachability
- **Dark Mode Support**: Color variants for light and dark themes
