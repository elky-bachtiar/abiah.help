    documents: DocumentSummary[];
    consultations: ConsultationSummary[];
    stats: UserStats;
  }

  interface Activity {
    id: string;
    type: 'document_created' | 'consultation_completed' | 'profile_updated' | 'feedback_submitted';
    title: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    metadata: Record<string, any>;
  }

  interface DocumentSummary {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    type: string;
    created_at: Date;
    last_modified: Date;
    thumbnail_url?: string;
  }

  interface ConsultationSummary {
    id: string;
    date: Date;
    duration: number; // in seconds
    summary?: string;
    recording_url?: string;
  }

  interface UserStats {
    total_consultation_minutes: number;
    total_documents_created: number;
    total_sessions: number;
